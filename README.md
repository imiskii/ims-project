# SHO Model of logistics - delivery/transport of goods and materials

## Assignment
Choose a company dealing with the transport of goods or materials. Model its structure and operation. In the experiments, focus on monitoring the economy of operation. Suggest savings, changes, different types of transport (rail, ship). Show the effect of the proposed changes on experiments.


## Brief

The objective of this project was to examine the operations of a goods transportation company. The focus was to suggest optimizations and develop a simulation model for testing the proposed changes. [Simulation Study](doc/simulation_study.pdf) provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis, proposed solutions, employed tools, and the obtained outcomes.
