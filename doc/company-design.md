### Strategy:

+ Choose one depo of Packeta company and make a model of its logistics
+ Make it futuristics:
    - Use electric car wherever possible (There are probably 3 main types of delivering **Depo to Depo**, **Depo to Z-Box/Partner** and **Depo to Address**)
    - On places where an electro mobile can not be used use classic gas automobiles (these will be mainly **depo to depo** and delivery to long distances)
    - Use autonomous cars (use papers and studies about the usability of an autonomous car)
    - Use drones (if previously mentioned wouldn't be enought)


### Required information:

+ abilities of autonomous cars
+ the price of operating an electric car
+ the price of operating an gas car
+ the price of the courier
+ $CO^2$ load for classic cars (gas)
+ $CO^2$ load for electric cars
+ number of Z-Boxes (Packeta web site)
+ number of packages delivered in one day 
    - packages delivered to other depos (may be irrelevant if there goes only one car)
    - packages delivered to Z-Boxes
    - packages delivered to address
+ Delivery distances
    - for Z-Boxes and partners it is easy to calculate from map
    - for **Depo to depo** delivery as well
    - for **to address** delivery use average value
+ Time for delivery (autonomous cars vs couriers)
    - suggested for autonomous cars
    - average for classic couriers delivery


### Variables:

+ Number of gas cars
+ Number of electric cars
+ Number of autonomous cars


### Thesis:

+ What time, $CO^2$ and financial savings can be realized when using a different ratio of the number of electric, autonomous and classic (gas) vehicles.
