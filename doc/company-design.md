### Strategy:

+ Choose one depo of Packeta company and make a model of its logistics (Žilina, Strečno)
    - Use electric cars
    - Use autonomous cars
    - Use normal cars
    - Compare


### Required information:

+ abilities of autonomous cars:
    + the price of operating an electric car
    + max load (in packages - how many packages it is able to delever in one charge)
    + max range
    + charging time
+ abilities of electric cars:
    + the price of operating an electric car
    + max range [212km] (loaded)
    + max load (not needed) [15 $m^3$] [100 adresa, 2500 Z-Box] TODO: popularity of Z-Boxes, make average of packages
    + charging time (not needed - bcs. it will charge outside of working hours)
+ abilities of normal cars:
    + the price of operating a normal car
    + same as electric cars
+ the price of the courier
+ Average delivery distances for "long" (only normal cars)
+ Average delivery distances for "short" (electric cars + autonomous cars) 
+ Time for autonomous cars  delivery


### Variables:

+ Number of simulating days
+ Number of packages for delivery per day
+ Number of gas cars
+ Number of electric cars
+ Number of autonomous cars


### Thesis:

+ What is the optimal ratio of normal, electric, and autonomous cars for packet delivery? What financial savings can be realized when using a different ratio of normal, electric, and autonomous cars?
